# Koreanisch Kochen – Learning Project

This repository contains a learning project built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.  
The goal is to explore modern frontend development concepts while building a real recipe website inspired by Korean cuisine.

## Purpose

The project serves as a playground to practice and refine:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript types and data structures
- Dynamic routing and recipe detail pages
- UI components and layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Clean project structure and maintainable code

While it started as a learning project, the long-term goal is to host this as a real website.

## Status

The codebase is a work in progress and will evolve over time.  
Features, structure, and styling may change as new ideas and concepts are tested and implemented.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
